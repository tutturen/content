# Relation Queries in the Simple API

Every available [relation](!alias-goh5uthoc1) in your [GraphQL schema](!alias-ahwoh2fohj) adds a new field to the [type queries]() of the two connected types.

For example, with the following schema:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: User @relation(name: "UserOnPost")
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name : String!
  posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "UserOnPost")
}
```

the following fields will be available:

* the `Post` and `allPosts` queries expose a new `author` field to [traverse one node]().
* the `User` and `allUsers` queries expose a new `posts` field  to [traverse many nodes]() and a `_postsMeta` to fetch [relation aggregation data]().
