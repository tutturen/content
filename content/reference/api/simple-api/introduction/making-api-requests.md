# Sending GraphQL Requests

To actually send a request to the Simple API, you first need to copy the [endpoint](!alias-yahph3foch#project-endpoints) URL assigned to your project which looks like this:

`https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__`

The Simple API is supposed to be consumed by GraphQL clients such as [Apollo Client](#apollo-client), or [lokka](#lokka) and can be also consumed with [plain HTTP requests](#curl).

## Apollo Client

### Usage

To set up the client with your endpoint:

```javascript
import ApolloClient, { createNetworkInterface } from 'apollo-client'

const client = new ApolloClient({
  networkInterface: createNetworkInterface({ uri: 'https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__' }),
})
```

Now you can use Apollo to do queries and mutations. If you are unsure about the setup, check our Instagram example app using Apollo in [React](https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-graphql/tree/master/quickstart-with-apollo) or [Angular 2](https://github.com/graphcool-examples/angular-graphql/tree/master/quickstart-with-apollo). Find more information in the official [documentation](http://dev.apollodata.com/).

## graphql-request

[`graphql-=request`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-request) is a minimal GraphQL client supporting Node and browsers for server-side scripts or simple applications.

### Usage

To set up the client with your endpoint:

```javascript
const { request } = require('graphql-request')

const query = `{
  Movie(title: "Inception") {
    releaseDate
    actors {
      name
    }
  }
}`

request('https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/movies', query).then(data => console.log(data))
```

## HTTP and WebSockets

### Queries and Mutations

You can also communicate with the Simple API by using plain HTTP POST requests. For example, to query `allUsers`, do a POST request to your endpoint `https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__`.

With `curl` you can query like this:

```bash
curl 'https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__' -H 'content-type: application/json' --data-binary '{"query":"query {allUsers {id name}}"}' --compressed
```

and do mutations like this:

```bash
curl 'https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__' -H 'content-type: application/json' --data-binary '{"query":"mutation {createUser(name: "Nilan") { id }}"}' --compressed
```

With `fetch` you could do:

```javascript
const response = await window.fetch('https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__', {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'content-type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: `
      query {
        allUsers {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    `
  })
})

const responseJSON = await response.json()
const data = responseJSON.data
```

### Subscriptions

When using Apollo Client, you can use `subscription-transport-ws` to combine it with a WebSocket client. [Here's an example](https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-graphql/tree/master/subscriptions-with-apollo-instagram).

You can also use any WebSocket client as described below.

#### Establish connection

Subscriptions are managed through WebSockets. First establish a WebSocket connection and specify the `graphql-subscriptions` protocol:

```javascript
let webSocket = new WebSocket('wss://subscriptions.graph.cool/v1/__PROJECT_ID__', 'graphql-subscriptions');
```
#### Initiate Handshake

Next you need to initiate a handshake with the WebSocket server. You do this by listening to the `open` event and then sending a JSON message to the server with the `type` property set to `init`:

```javascript
webSocket.onopen = (event) => {
  const message = {
      type: 'init'
  }

  webSocket.send(JSON.stringify(message))
}
```

#### React to Messages

The server may respond with a variety of messages distinguished by their `type` property. You can react to each message as appropriate for your application:

```javascript
webSocket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data)

  switch (data.type) {
    case 'init_success': {
      console.log('init_success, the handshake is complete')
      break
    }
    case 'init_fail': {
      throw {
        message: 'init_fail returned from WebSocket server',
        data
      }
    }
    case 'subscription_data': {
      console.log('subscription data has been received', data)
      break
    }
    case 'subscription_success': {
      console.log('subscription_success')
      break
    }
    case 'subscription_fail': {
      throw {
        message: 'subscription_fail returned from WebSocket server',
        data
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Subscribe to Data Changes

To subscribe to data changes, send a message with the `type` property set to `subscription_start`:

```javascript
const message = {
  id: '1',
  type: 'subscription_start',
  query: `
    subscription newPosts {
      Post(filter: {
        mutation_in: [CREATED]
      }) {
        mutation
        node {
          description
          imageUrl
        }
      }
    }
  `
}

webSocket.send(JSON.stringify(message))
```

You should receive a message with `type` set to `subscription_success`. When data changes occur, you will receive messages with `type` set to `subscription_data`. The `id` property that you supply in the `subscription_start` message will appear on all `subscription_data` messages, allowing you to multiplex your WebSocket connection.

#### Unsubscribe from Data Changes

To unsubscribe from data changes, send a message with the `type` property set to `subscription_end`:

```javascript
const message = {
  id: '1',
  type: 'subscription_end'
}

webSocket.send(JSON.stringify(message))
```
